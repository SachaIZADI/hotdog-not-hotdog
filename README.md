# hotdog-not-hotdog

This short project was a work assignement given during Polytechnique's advanced Machine Learning class (MAP541). I chosed to build a binary classifier hot-dog vs. salad inspired by the well-known Silicon Valley's Hotdog / Not Hotdog app

I applied transfer learning techniques using VGG16 architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet database. I used its output (before the classification layer) to feed an additional layer that I trained. Ah, and I used Keras for R.
